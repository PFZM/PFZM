# 👋 Hi, I'm Pablo Zambrano

I'm a **Data Engineer** with a strong focus on automation, scalable infrastructure, and real-time data delivery. With a background in consulting, hospitality, and data engineering, I thrive at the intersection of technical excellence and clear communication.

I’m especially interested in the aviation domain — but more broadly, I work on projects that blend cloud infrastructure, automation, and data visualization to solve real-world challenges across industries.
